##RideHub: Compare Uber and Lyft Prices
Project Overview
RideHub is a mobile app that empowers users to make smarter, cost-effective travel choices by seamlessly comparing Uber and Lyft prices. The goal is to help users quickly determine the best option for their journey, ensuring faster and cheaper rides based on preferences like distance and destination.

Features:
Login to RideHub: Start by logging into the app.
Input Start and End Locations: Users enter their journeyâ€™s start and end points.
Price Comparison: The app fetches and displays fare estimates for Uber and Lyft, allowing users to compare the costs of both services.
Select Preferred Ride: Users can choose the ride that fits their needs.
Seamless Integration: Once the user selects their preferred ride, the app directs them to either Uber or Lyft to complete the booking.
Inspiration
RideHub was inspired by the daily experiences of college students who depend on buses, trains, carpools, or ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft for transportation. These services can become expensive, and RideHub aims to offer a convenient solution by directly comparing the prices of both platforms, helping students and others save on their transportation costs.

Mission Statement
Empowering riders to make smarter, cost-effective travel choices by seamlessly comparing Lyft and Uber prices in one app.
